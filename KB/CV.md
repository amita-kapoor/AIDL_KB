# Computer Vision (CV)

* Momentarily the most recommended resource for Deep Learning on Computer Vision is the [cs231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), most of the other resources are either derivative or have glaring problems. 
* One other course which is good is the Udacity free [Introduction to Computer Vision Course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud810)it is the same course taught at Georgia Tech Master curriculum. The course has assignments in Octave/Matlab

## Recommended resources
* [Awesome Deep Vision](https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-deep-vision)

## Scientific Papers
* The most cited
  * [Image Segmentation, Object Detection](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers#image-segmentation--object-detection)
